# Portfolio Site (GitHub Pages)

This folder contains a ready-to-deploy personal portfolio for **Ertugrul Tunc**.

## Quick Start

1. **Create a special repo** named: `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io` (replace with your GitHub username).
2. Upload the files from this folder (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `assets/`, etc.) to that repo.
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and ensure the site is served from the **main branch** and **root**.
4. Your site will be live at: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`.

> Replace placeholders in `index.html`:
> - `YOUR_GITHUB_URL`
> - `YOUR_LINKEDIN_URL`
> - `YOUR_THESIS_REPO_URL`
> - Optionally replace `assets/profile.png` with your photo.

## Custom Domain (Optional)

1. Buy a domain (e.g., `ertugrultunc.com` or `.ie`).
2. In your repo, add a file named **CNAME** containing just your domain.
3. In your domain DNS, add **A** records pointing to GitHub Pages IPs and a **CNAME** for `www` → `YOUR-USERNAME.github.io`. See GitHub Pages docs for current IPs.
4. Wait for DNS to propagate.

## Edit Locally

You can edit text and sections directly in `index.html` and styles in `styles.css`.
